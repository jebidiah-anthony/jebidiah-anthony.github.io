<blockquote>
  <p>This is a brief introduction to <strong>Cross Origin Resource Sharing</strong> along with common misconfigurations that might lead to exploitation. This was an entry to mubix’s OSCP giveaway challenge 3. I did not win but I still really learned a lot which is still a great takeaway.</p>

  <p>An elastalert rule tester built using python. Tests could be set-up uniquely and could be run by batch. Specified logs are indexed using <a href="https://www.elastic.co/downloads/past-releases/elasticsearch-7-4-0"><strong>Elasticsearch 7.4.0</strong></a> and are used with a custom elastalert <a href="https://github.com/jebidiah-anthony/elastalerter/blob/master/elastalerter/alerter.py">alerter</a>. This program covers testing for single matches and log aggregation with field mapping capabilities. (<a href="https://github.com/jebidiah-anthony/elastalerter/blob/master/elastalerter.py">source code</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The double-hop problem occurs when, for example, a local PowerShell instance connected via PSRemoting to a remote server which is connected to the target server and an attempt to execute commands on the target server was made and was rejected. The end goal of this proof-of-concept is to execute a pass-the-ticket attack on an active directory while being remotely connected to a domain computer with administrator privileges.</p>
