== PART 2 : GIVEN INFORMATION

There are three things that were given for this challenge:

First is a series of notes when opening the web application:
   
____

I cleaned it up a bit and it looks like this:

----
A  Ab B  C# D# C  F  Db C  Eb A  B  B  Bb F# Ab Gb A# A  Bb C# G# Ab Bb
D# D  C  Eb B  A  Bb G  E  G# F  Eb B  E  A# Gb B  D  E  Ab Bb F# C  C  G
Eb B  A  A# Db F# B  F  F# C# Db A  A# Gb A# Gb B  G  B  C  Ab C  E  A# Bb Bb A#
A# Ab B  F  Ab B  A  B  C  D# F# Db D  Eb F  E  C  Bb Gb C# A  A  G  F# Db C  C# B

____

Next is a series of keys that will probably be used to decipher the `subliminal messsages` (as described in the challenge description):

Interval key: perfect fifth, minor third, major seventh
Interval key: minor second, minor sixth, perfect fourth

I forget which interval is used for which octave, but I know that it's 2 each
----
____

And lastly is how to decipher the `subliminal messages` using the information above:

____
+++<strong style="color:orange">There are 12 notes per octave in a 12TET, which means we can properly fit the entire alphanumeric range within three octaves.</strong>+++ We've made it that the digits follow the letters.
+++<strong style="color:orange">Each character is represented by a note in the octave.</strong>+++ For example, the default arrangement is that letter A corresponds to note C, letter B to C# or Db, C to D, etc.
Then the notes start repeating once you reach the letter M, so now letter M is note C, N is C#, etc. And you go all the way until you're done with the numbers as well.

It wouldn't be much of a cipher if we just stopped here. We wanted it to be more complex. +++<strong style="color:orange">We can change the arrangement by transposing the notes in all three blocks by a select interval.</strong>+++
Let's say the first block is being transposed by a major second (2 semitones, in keeping with the musical theme). That means that letter A now corresponds to note D, letter D# or Eb, C to E, etc. The same applies to the other two blocks.

But why stop there? +++<strong style="color:orange">We also had the other two blocks not only be transposed, but also modulated.</strong>+++ That is to say, +++<strong style="color:orange">after they have been offset by the "transposition" interval</strong>+++ (major second) +++<strong style="color:orange">I add the "modulation" intervals for each block.</strong>+++

For the second block let's pick a minor third, which makes that 5 semitones (2 + 3) from C to F. Remember, the first block is offset *only* by the transposition interval, but we start at the F note on the second. Now, the letter M (first letter of the second block) is F, N is F# or Gb , O is G, etc.
The same principle applies to the third block: If the second modulation (offset interval for the third block) is a fifth (7 semitones above; 2 + 7 = 9; 9 semitones from C is A), then letter Y (first letter of the third block) is A, Z is A# or Bb, (now we're starting with numbers) number 0 is B, 1 is C, etc.
+++<strong style="color:orange">The three musical intervals (transposition, first modulation and second modulation) make up the *interval* key used to decode the cipher.</strong>+++

Next up are the octaves which determine which of the notes correspond to which letter/number.
Each block has its own starting octave, and octave numbers always begin with the C note.
If we were to transpose a piece starting at B1 (the last note in the first octave) by a perfect fifth higher (7 semitones) then the next 7 notes belong to the higher octave (C2, C#2, D2, D#2, E2, F2 and F#2).
In this case, our transposed piece now starts with F#2. The most important thing to remember is that octaves start with the letter C#, therefore +++<strong style="color:orange">the octave number will always become one higher every time we reach the next C.</strong>+++

+++<strong style="color:orange">The starting octave for each block is the first part of the *octave* key.</strong>+++
This is +++<strong style="color:orange">represented by the leading three-digit number of the octave key,</strong>+++ where the first digit is the octave number for the first block, the second digit for the second block and the third digit for the third block.
+++<strong style="color:orange">The rest of the trailing octave numbers in the octave key correspond to each of the notes in the ciphertext.</strong>+++

+++<strong style="color:orange">As an added challenge, we decided to reverse the flow of notes for one of the lines.</strong>+++

== PART 2 : GENERATING THE KEYS

In summary,

We have three blocks (octaves) at the beginning to represent alphanumeric characters:

____
----
Block 1
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L

Block 2
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X

Block 3
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
Y  Z  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
----
____

Using the first octave key given -- `+++<strong style="color:orange">317381429294288138823834883</strong>+++`, it says that the +++<strong style="color:orange">3 leading numbers</strong>+++ are the octave for each block so in this case we will use `+++<strong style="color:orange">317</strong>+++`:

____
----
Block 1 
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3  3
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L

Block 2
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1  1
M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X

Block 3
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7  7
Y  Z  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
----
____

Next is that the first block will be transposed by a select interval, the second block will be transposed and then modulated (block1 transposition + block2 modulation), and the same goes with the third block (block1 transposition + block3 modulation)

If we use the first given interval key -- `+++<strong style="color:orange">perfect fifth, minor third, major seventh</strong>+++`, the first block will be transposed to the right by a perfect fifth (7 semitones), the second block by modulating by minor third (7 + 3 semitones), and the third block by modulating by a major seventh (7 + 11 semitones).

Applying this to the three blocks above, we will have:

____
If we have:
----
C  C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B
0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11

Perfect Fifth =  7 semitones
Minor Third   =  3 semitones
Major Seventh = 11 semitones
----

Then:
----

There were only 2 sets of octave blocks given -- it was `+++<strong style="color:orange">317</strong>+++` and `+++<strong style="color:orange">852</strong>+++`. The same goes for interval keys; only two were given `+++<strong style="color:orange">`perfect fifth, minor third, major seventh</strong>+++` and `+++<strong style="color:orange">minor second, minor sixth, perfect fourth</strong>+++`

Applying the respecitve octave keys given to the respective interval keys, we get:

The generated keys above from the octave and interval keys above are only an assumption up to this point since it was also mentioned that the interval keys are each used for two of the octave keys and it wasn't stated which ones does. However, it wouldn't be much of a problem since the transposition of notes remains the same and only the octave in which they belong will change.

It was also stated that for one of the octave keys, the flow of notes were reversed so it will be something that will be tackled later on in this writeup.

----
____

The third line was not even remotely decoded so it must be the one where the flow of notes was reversed.

---

== PART 3 : THE REVERSED FLOW

If normal transposition is done by shifting to the right then maybe for this, we should transpose to the left.

The interval key, `+++<strong style="color:orange">minor second, minor sixth, perfect fourth</strong>+++`, has only deciphered one message so far so we will be using this when transposing with a reversed flow.

____
So if we have:
----
C# D  D# E  F  F# G  G# A  A# B  C
11 10 9  8  7  6  5  4  3  2  1  0

Minor Second   = 1 semitones
Minor Sixth    = 8 semitones
Perfect Fourth = 5 semitones
----

Then:
