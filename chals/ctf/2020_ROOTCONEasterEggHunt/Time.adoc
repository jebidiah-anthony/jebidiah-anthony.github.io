== PART 1 : CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION

Opening the http://easteregg.rootcon.net/rceaster/time/[challenge] brings you to:

image::time_home.png[]

which reads the following: 

----
I think someone stole the eggs here.
They were pretty messy. Leaving these crumbs everywhere.
I gathered them for you to compare adventurer. Go forth. Hydaelyn awaits for you valiant success 
in uncovering the secrets of these "eggs" that have spawned on the Second Umbral Moon of our time.


Urianger's Notes: 

These cryptic messages seem to have some similarities. Perhaps the same key was used? 
Although it is naught but a guess of mine, pray do help in figuring it out.

== PART 2 : IDENTIFYING THE CIPHER

We are given two ciphertexts with lengths *68* and *66* (as hex characters) respectively. Since it has different lengths, I dropped the assumption that it was encrypted using a block cipher which also removes substitution-permutation. Also with the limited given, it doesn't seem to involve assymetric cryptography and based on the randomness of each character byte, it doesn't look like a direct substitution either.

What was said, however, was that +++<strong style="color:orange">the same key was perhaps used to encrypt</strong>+++ both ciphertexts and the arbitrary lengths led me to believe that the plaintext was hidden using a repeated XOR key or maybe +++<strong>a One Time Pad which coincides well with the challenge theme</strong>+++.

Other things:

* There is a *`Q`* character at the end of *`Message1`* but I found it quite irrelevant. 
* I couldn't find a cipher that ends with a *`Q`*.
* Counting it with the ciphertext brings the length to an odd number so I dropped it.

== PART 3 : GETTING THE FLAG

If this is ineed a +++<span style="color:orange">One Time Pad</span>+++ and the key was reused for both ciphertexts, then it may be decrypted via a +++<span style="color:red">Crib Dragging</span>+++ attack.

+++<strong style="color:red">Crib Dragging</strong>+++
____
It is where you decrypt a ciphertext by XORing a known portion of the plaintext then shifting it right until another likely plaintext string is revealed.
____

With *One Time Pads*,The ciphertext (latexmath:[Ciphertext_n]) is produced by XORing (latexmath:[\oplus]) the plaintext (latexmath:[Message_n]) and the key (latexmath:[K]) where the key and plaintext has the same length.
____

. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 = Message_1 \oplus K] +++</span>+++

. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[Ciphertext_2 = Message_2 \oplus K] +++</span>+++
____


How does this help with the attack?
____
Consider this: 

. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2] +++</span>+++

By substituting values, we get:

[start=2]
. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[(Message_1 \oplus K) \oplus (Message_2 \oplus K)] +++</span>+++

And since the key (latexmath:[K]) is reused for both messages:

[start=3]
. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[Message_1 \oplus Message_2] +++</span>+++

If *latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2 = (Message_1 \oplus K) \oplus (Message_2 \oplus K)]*, then:

[start=4]
. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2 = Message_1 \oplus Message_2] +++</span>+++

Which also means that:

[start=5]
. +++<span style="color:orange">+++ latexmath:[(Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2) \oplus Message_1 = Message_2] +++</span>+++
____

Proceeding to the attack:
____
Finding the value of *latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2]*:

XOR 8380cb903366dd4b7822ba48a9dacf8b6b4b6aa81df1f14b46afd4736ae9111ee2

----

Now, we guess a portion of the plaintext then encode it in hex. It is advisable to use simple words first but to each their own:

----
easter => 656173746572
----

Then, XOR it with the value from *latexmath:[Ciphertext_1 \oplus Ciphertext_2]*:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    ##00573c065143##1a502d4e47570b506e405d02696f560b296f460a6c41045600121493
XOR #656173746572# (easter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #65364f723431# (e6Or41)
----

But the value returned is gibberish, so then we shift the XOR to the right:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    00573c##0651431a502d##4e47570b506e405d02696f560b296f460a6c41045600121493
XOR       #656173746572# (easter)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
          #6330306e355f# (c00n5_)
----

Shifting three bytes to the right returns `c00n5_` which looks like a portion of the flag, now trying the flag format, c which fits well with the shift and it returns:

[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
    ##00573c0651431a502d4e##47570b506e405d02696f560b296f460a6c41045600121493
XOR #72635f6561737465727b# (rc_easter{)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    #7234636330306e355f35# (r4cc00n5_5)
----

We get the word, +++<span style="color:orange">r4cc00n5</span>+++, in 1337 speak followed by what seems to be a word that starts with +++<span style="color:orange">5</span>+++ (`letter S`). According to the challenge, eggs were stolen and the image references to a *evil plotting raccoon meme* which made me try to guess the string one word at a time along the lines of +++<span style="color:red">the raccoons stole the eggs</span>+++

To my surprise, the flag was revealed.
